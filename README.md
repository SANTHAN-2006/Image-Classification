## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1: Problem Statement
Define the objective of classifying handwritten digits (0-9) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

### STEP 2:Dataset Collection
Use the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.
### STEP 3: Data Preprocessing
Convert images to tensors, normalize pixel values, and create DataLoaders for batch processing.
### STEP 4:Model Architecture
Design a CNN with convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
### STEP 5:Model Training
Train the model using a suitable loss function (CrossEntropyLoss) and optimizer (Adam) for multiple epochs.
### STEP 6:Model Evaluation
Test the model on unseen data, compute accuracy, and analyze results using a confusion matrix and classification report.
### STEP 7: Model Deployment & Visualization
Save the trained model, visualize predictions, and integrate it into an application if needed.
